# Pong-game
A game I made in my programming class in the Greenfoot enviorment. The game consists of two paddles that hit a ball back and forth. The ball can go through traps that will change its speed and/or direction. Players score points by hitting the opposite wall and past the other paddle. The first player to 4 points wins.
